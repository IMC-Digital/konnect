    <h2>What is 2-Dimentional Echocardiography?</h2>
    <p>
        2-Dimentional Echocardiography or ECHO is used to visualize the actual motion of the heart. On the monitor, a cone-shaped 2D ECHO view shows the real-time motion of the heart's structures. This enables the healthcare provider to observe and assess the various structures of the heart in action when an individual experiences chest pain or shortness of breath. 
        Thus, it helps in the diagnosis of various heart ailments such as atherosclerosis, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, etc.

    <h2>How does 2-Dimentional Echocardiography work?</h2>
    <p>During the 2D ECHO procedure, a transducer (similar to a microphone) emits sound waves at a very high frequency. Depending on where and how the transducer is placed on the chest, the sound waves pass through the skin and other body tissues to reach the heart, where they bounce or "echo" off of the heart's structures. Finally, these sound waves are transmitted to a computer to produce moving pictures of the heart walls and valves.</p>

    <h2>When is 2D ECHO recommended?</h2>
    <p>
        2D ECHO is commonly used to check for heart-related complications. This procedure demonstrates how blood flows through the heart's chambers and valves and helps to diagnose conditions such as atherosclerosis (clogged arteries), arrhythmia (irregular heartbeats), heart valve diseases, etc.
        Doctors recommend this test if any individual experiences symptoms such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chest pain</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h2>What preparation is needed for 2D ECHO?</h2>
    <p>
        Ensure your healthcare provider is aware of what prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines, or dietary supplements you are taking. Ask your doctor for details about pre-test preparations, and make sure to follow instructions closely.
        It is necessary to take off the upper body clothing and change into a hospital gown at the testing facility for a 2D ECHO test, and it is recommended to remove any jewelry and other metallic objects that might interfere with the testing procedure.

    <h2>What are the advantages of 2D ECHO?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It is typically painless and doesnâ€™t require needles, injections, or incisions.</li>
        <li>It is safer compared to diagnostic methods such as X-rays and CT scans because patients aren't exposed to ionizing radiation.</li>
        <li>It produces clearer and more detailed images than traditional X-rays. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How long does 2D ECHO take? </h2>
    <p>The duration of a 2D ECHO can range from 30 to 60 minutes.</p>

    <h2>What are the risks of 2D ECHO? </h2>
    <p>2D ECHO is safe with no known risks.</p>
