          <h3 className="question">What is the package for?</h3>
          <p>
            Konnect Cancer Screening - Male package is required for the early
            detection of cancer in males. This package is used to check for the
            presence of colon, prostate, lung, skin, oral cancer, etc. before
            the appearance of any symptoms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regular screenings can help detect some cancer cells at an early
            stage when they are still small and have not spread. A delay in
            diagnosis causes the cancer to spread to various parts of the body,
            which makes treatment extremely difficult. If detected early,
            cancers such as testicular and prostate cancer can be completely
            treated.
          </p>
          <h3 className="question">Who should opt for this package?</h3>
          <p>
